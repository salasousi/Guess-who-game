<h2>Description</h2>
    Guess Who: World Cup Edition 
  </br> In honor of the 2022 World Cup, I designed a game that allows a user to guess the football star.
  <ul>
    <li> A headshot of a randomly selected football player will be shown to the user </li>
    <li> The user will have to guess the player based on the image shown by inputing their last name into the text box and clicking the guess button</li>
    <li> An optional hint button is included... when the user clicks the player's headshot photo, the playerâ€™s country and position will be revealed</li>
    <li> The user has the option to generate a new player at their leisure by the click of a button </li>
  </ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li> HTML5</li>
  <li> CSS</li>
<li> JavaScript/jQuery</li>
<li> Sportmonks Database API</li>
<li> Git/Github</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Set a limit on amount of guesses allowed by user and display to the DOM</li>
  <li> Fix the bug that limits the amount of placeholder images shown for the player's headshot</li>
  <li> Use CSS and JavaScripts hide/show features to only display a portion of the player's headshot, with each guess a new portion will be revealed</li>
  </ul>
